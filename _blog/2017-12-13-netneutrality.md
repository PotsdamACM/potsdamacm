On November 21st, FCC chairperson Ajit Pai released his plan to “Restore Internet Freedom”.


This plan will do away with the Open Internet Order, regulations preventing discriminatory practices by internet service providers and allowing people to freely access and interact with information online.


The FCC is made up of five commissioners appointed by the sitting president (Rump), and it is always skewed 3-2 in favor of the president’s party. Pai’s proposal is expected to pass.


Tomorrow, December 14th, at 10:30am ET, the FCC will vote on Ajit Pai’s proposal.

Live video of the debate will be available here https://www.fcc.gov/general/live.

If you are on this mailing list, you are at least interested in computer science. An Internet without net neutrality will harm the efforts of developers building and shipping software, as well as harm user experience and user access to your application.


The majority of Americans only have one or two broadband choices. Market discipline alone does not guarantee continued openness.


“Why should they be allowed to use my pipes? The Internet can't be free in that sense, because we and the cable companies have made an investment and for a Google or Yahoo or Vonage or anybody to expect to use these pipes free is nuts.”  Ed Whitacre, former AT&T CEO



Verizon (Ajit’s former employer) told a federal court in 2013 that it believed it could charge any online service whatever amount it wanted to get to Verizon’s subscribers—and be able to cut off websites that didn’t pay up. http://fortune.com/2017/11/22/net-neutrality-fcc-ajit-pai-verizon-comcast-att/



What you can do:

Congress has the power to take real action to ensure the Internet remains an open platform for speech and commerce. Let your congressperson know that you oppose efforts to roll back net neutrality.
