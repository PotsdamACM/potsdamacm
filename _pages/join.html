      <p>
        As of Spring 2018, ACM meets in Dunn 206 every Friday, at 4pm. ACM-W meets as announced in ACM. <br> <br>
        We hope to engage interested students through regular meetings, lightning talks, and interactive workshops.

        <h2>Attend ACM</h2>
        <p>The best way you can get involved is to coming to regular Friday meetings. The meetings kick-off with some announcements, and then we go over our upcoming events. <br>
        We encourage everyone to share project updates and lightning talks. <br>
        Lightning talks are quick presentations on what's going on in tech, personal projects, anything at all.

        <h2>Attend ACM-W</h2>
        <p>
          ACM-W times are announced at ACM. <br>
          ACM-W meetings are run by a selected moderator. The moderator picks a topic, presents on it, and opens discussion. <br>
          ACM-W is a safe space. We often talk about the department climate and diversity issues in STEM. <br>
          All are welcome.

        <h2>Leadership</h2>
        <p>We are always looking for help. All volunteers are listed on the <a href="/org">organization page</a>. <br>
        We are looking for regular admins.
        Admins are invited to executive board meetings, and the level of involvement is entirely up to the volunteer. It's eboard-lite.
        Help your local community, have full autonomy over your workload, and add something to your resume.
