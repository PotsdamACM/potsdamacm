    <h3>ACM-W meets on Sundays when scheduled, always announced at ACM.</h4>
    <p> A typical ACM-W meeting: a presentation on the set topic, then discussion. <br>
      Our club is structured differently than most. Each meeting is run entirely by one ACM-W organizer; this organizer serves as the speaker and the moderator.
      The position of the moderator cycles between the organizers, and any student can be an organizer. <br>
      The SUNY Potsdam ACM-W is completely driven by student volunteers. <br>
      This has brought out the best in our ACM-W members; no one does work they don't want to do, and moderators are free to chose the topics they are passionate about.</p>
