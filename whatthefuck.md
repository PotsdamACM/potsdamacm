# issues:
### moving from 1 html page to multiple broke how we handle displaying content...
**old** css grid, areas "h" "c" "f" for header, content, footer rows

**new** ??? I need to refactor, I don't know what the fuck its doing

### footer
when the content doesn't fill up the remaining space on the page, the footer breaks

### everything
this started as "oh lets learn grid" to "its so cute lets play with styling" to "the website should be so easy to make now" to "lets migrate it to use jekyll" to "oh dear god what have I done"

### eboard
styling breaks on Chrome. Not a big deal, it's all filler shit for now.
