# issues:

### footer header
hardcoded to be a maximum size, which is dumb and annoying

### everything
this started as "oh lets learn grid" to "its so cute lets play with styling" to "the website should be so easy to make now" to "lets migrate it to use jekyll" to "oh dear god what have I done"

### eboard
styling breaks on Chrome. Not a big deal, it's all filler shit for now.
